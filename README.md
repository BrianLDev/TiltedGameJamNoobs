# Hangry Santa

## Description

Santa's gone stir crazy up at the North Pole!  He missed both breakfast and lunch today and is so hangry, he's eating everything in sight, including the elves.  

Rudolph is here to save the day, once again.

The object of the game is to make sure Santa doesn't eat the elves, and also make sure he doesn't eat too much food that he balloons to the size of a skyscraper.  Eating food and Elves will make him bigger. I wonder if there's a way to shrink him down...

Originally created for the Tilted Game Jam Orange County on 12-21-2019 by a rag tag team of Game Jam free agents of varying skill levels and talents.  

75% of the team was new to Unity, new to git, and new to Game Jams, so our goal was just to have fun with it and learn a few things along the way.

Continued to improve the game after the game jam so that we could all have a completed and working game under our belts.
